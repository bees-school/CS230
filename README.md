The Gaming Room is a game dev company who want to make their game web-based. Meaning that it has to operate on a multitude of platforms/OSes such as Windows, Mac, and mobile devices. Within the document provided, I feel I did best at the evaluation board provided and finding the differences and best parts of each operating system. If I had to pick one part to revise it would the summary section at the very start of the document as I feel like I could have done a better job at explaining what the client needed/wanted.
